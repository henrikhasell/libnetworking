		<h1>libnetworking</h1>
		<h2>Why I made libnetworking:</h2>
		<p>
			As a developer, I wanted to create a cross-platform,
			multi-player video game for the PC.
			I chose the C programming language because it is simple 
			and easy to understand.
			I realised there was no networking library that fit my 
			specific needs: Lightweight, minimalistic, cross-platform 
			and UDP-based networking.
			Though networking libraries exist for C, I felt they were 
			either too bloated, or did not contain features that 
			I needed to have in my application: IPv6 compatibility, 
			modularity and simplicity.
		</p>
		<h2>Why I did not use the Berkley Sockets API model:</h2>
		<p>
			It is implemented differently in Windows and UNIX. 
			For further information, please see WinSock.
			I have made cross-platform applications with this API in the past, 
			but it was a nightmare to work with.
			I reasoned it would be less work for me in the long run if I made 
			my own compatibility layer for WinSock/UNIX to eliminate the 
			differences between the API. This is in essence what libnetworking is.
		</p>
		<h2>This library is designed to address three issues:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				It removes the platform specific differences 
				of the C BSD socket API, allowing for truly 
				platform independent code.
			</li>
			<li>
				It provides a easy to use networking API fully 
				compatible with IPv6 IP addresses.
			</li>
			<li>
				It contains a framework built from the ground up, 
				designed for streaming information via UDP. 
				This includes the ability to monitor and account 
				for packet loss.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Networking Sub-system:</h2>
		<h3>Networking_Initialise</h3>
		<code>int Networking_Initialise()</code>
		<p>
			This function initialises all of the libraries components.
			It should be called before any other function from this library.
		</p>
		<code>
			#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br/>
			#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;<br/>
			#include &lt;networking.h&gt;<br/>
			<br/>
			int main(int argc char *argv[]){<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(Networking_Initialise() &lt; 0){<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf("Failed to initialise the networking subsystem.\n");<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return EXIT_FAILURE;<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Networking_Cleanup();<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return EXIT_SUCCESS;<br/>
			}<br/>
